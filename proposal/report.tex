\noindent We are interested in applying the knowledge of machine learning to
the domain of
 game theory. Many instances of game theoretic applications assume complete
 availability of information in the games, but this might not be always
 true~\cite{Blum:2006}. Also, repeated application of a machine learning
 algorithm to the game might speed-up the achievement of the
 equilibrium~\cite{Freund:1996}. Sponsored search
 hosts an online auction among the advertisers to bid for the advertisements
 that the latter wish to present to the customers. The achievement of the
 equilibrium state in this case is also an application of the machine learning
 algorithms to game theory and we expect to get better results since the
complete domain knowledge in the game might not be available~\cite{He:2013}.\\

\noindent As a part of this project study, we plan to study these three papers -
\cite{Freund:1996},~\cite{Blum:2006},~\cite{He:2013} - in detail (more related
 papers, if necessary) and attempt to improve upon the algorithms proposed. If
 our attempt is successful we plan to apply that algorithm to a real game and
 test the results and verify the validity of the algorithm compared to the
 state-of-the-art models.
